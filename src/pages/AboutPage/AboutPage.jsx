            <h2>Our Story:</h2>

            <p>
               The journey of Lamadoro began with a team of passionate
               individuals who faced the common struggle of maintaining focus
               and managing time efficiently in their own lives. We realized the
               importance of structured work intervals and breaks to boost
               productivity and overall well-being. Determined to find a
               solution, we embarked on a mission to create an app that would
               revolutionize the way people approach time management.

            <h2>What is Lamadoro?</h2>

            <p>
               Lamadoro is a simple and intuitive app that combines the power of
               the Pomodoro Technique with smart features to optimize your work
               sessions. With Lamadoro, you can divide your work into manageable
               intervals, called "Lamadors," and take regular breaks to recharge
               and refocus. By following this structured approach, you'll
               experience improved productivity, reduced burnout, and increased
               motivation.

            <h2>Key Features:</h2>

            <p>
               <strong>Lamadors:</strong> Lamadoro helps you break down your
               work into focused intervals, typically 25 minutes long, known as
               Lamadors. These short bursts of productivity help you maintain
               concentration and avoid distractions.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
               <strong>Breaks:</strong> After each Lamador, Lamadoro reminds you
               to take a well-deserved break. Use this time to relax, stretch,
               grab a healthy snack, or simply recharge. Taking regular breaks
               ensures that you stay refreshed and motivated throughout your
               work sessions.
            </p>
